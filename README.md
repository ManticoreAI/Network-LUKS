# Network-LUKS
A Security Primitive that uses "Multifactor" Network authentication to secure bootups!  Process: We setup a central auth-server with SecureBoot, This allows multiple OSes that are not secure-boot enabled, such as LiveUSBs to prove their integrity and decrypt their rootfs! Kernel starts to boat and loads Net-LUKS driver, Net-Luks downloads a unique key from a central auth-server, it Then appends the key Checksums the entire InitramFS Memory Space, This Checksum is sent back to the authServe, The auth-server sends back 1/2 of the Luks Key and stores it in a TPM Cryptoprocessor! - Now the user types the 2nd half of his/her Decryption key! And Net-LUKS combines them to decrypt rootfs!
